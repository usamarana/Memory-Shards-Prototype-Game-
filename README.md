# Memory-Shards-Prototype-Game-
FPS Prototype game made in C# using unity engine. This game was developed as a project for my Graphics and Visualisation module.
A survival game which involves exploring the world while surviving enemies which will chase the player. For each enemy the player kills, there is a chance that the enemies can drop different items to supply the player so he can carry on surviving and kill more enemies until he reaches the boss and defeats him.
